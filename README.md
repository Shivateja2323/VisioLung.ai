### 🧾 System Workflow
1. The user uploads a chest X-ray image.  
2. The image is preprocessed and analyzed by the Swin Transformer model.  
3. The AI predicts potential abnormalities with confidence levels.  
4. The system generates a detailed report (PDF) including:
   - Predicted disease  
   - Confidence score  
   - Patient details (Name, Age, Gender)  
   - Advisory notes and disclaimer  
5. Users can also search for nearby pulmonologists for follow-up.
